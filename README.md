# Simple Testimonials
A simple & straight forward WordPress plugin that allows you to create testimonials with citations and categories.

## Usage
To keep this plugin as flexible as possible, it outputs no styles or HTML structure
so you must use a WordPress Query in your theme template to get the testimonials.

The registered names for the post types and taxonomies are below:

- Post Type: `simple_testimonials`
- Categories: `simple_testimonials_categories`
- Tags: `simple_testimonials_tags`

## Important Notes on Slugs

- Simple Testimonials uses a custom archive slug of `/testimonials/` to access testimonial archives.
- Simple Testimonials uses a custom permalink of `/testimonial/` for single posts.
